# KinectToCAD

## a hobby-project for converting kinect images into CAD-readable files

Following steps need to be done:
- grab a Xbox Kinect
- create pointclouds from given data
- rearrange pointclouds from different views and create a polygon mesh
- create interactive web gui to execute the .cpp code and visualize 3d models
- turn mesh into cad readable files and do something else with it (3d print etc)
